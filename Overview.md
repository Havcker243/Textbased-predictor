# README: Text Frequency Analyzer Application

## Overview

The Text Frequency Analyzer is an application designed for analyzing texts by tracking the frequency of words. It is capable of calculating the number of times each word appears in a text and can also filter words that are mentioned within a specified frequency range.

While the application is not built to directly measure lexical density, the data it generates can be valuable for linguists and text analysts who wish to study or infer lexical density and other aspects of text complexity and style.

## Lexical Density

Lexical density is a linguistic metric that refers to the ratio of content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) to the total number of words in a text. Texts with a higher proportion of content words relative to function words (such as “and”, “the”, “is”) are considered to have higher lexical density. This typically indicates a more complex and information-rich text. Conversely, a lower lexical density suggests a more conversation-like and accessible text.

## Application Utility in Lexical Density Analysis

By analyzing word frequencies using this application, one can observe the prevalence of low-frequency, content-rich words compared to high-frequency function words. For example, if the application reveals a high number of specialized and low-frequency words in a scientific paper, it may suggest a high lexical density.

### Practical Example

The application was used to analyze Einstein's ‘Relativity’ and found that words like “abscissa”, “nebulae”, “auxiliary”, “avail”, and “epochmaking” appear sparingly. The presence of such low-frequency, content-rich words suggests a high lexical density. In contrast, in Herman Melville’s ‘Moby Dick’, words like "Nantucket", "project", and "leviathan" appeared more frequently, but high-frequency function words were even more dominant, suggesting varying lexical density levels throughout the book.

## Using the Application

To use the application, input the text you want to analyze. The application will output the frequency of each word and can filter words that fall within a user-specified frequency range.

## Conclusion

The Text Frequency Analyzer application provides data on word frequencies, which can be an invaluable resource for linguists, authors, and analysts to infer and study the lexical density of various texts, thereby offering insights into their complexity and style. While it doesn't measure lexical density directly, the frequency data it generates is instrumental in making informed analyses.
